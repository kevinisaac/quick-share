# quick-share
QuickShare is a simple browser plugin that allows you to share a URL with a friend.

# How it works?
It has two components.
  1. The web API
  2. The browser extension

Every user first creates an account in the website. Then, he can share his username/email with his friends.The user should be able to share any URL via the plugin with any other user who has the browser extension, through his username/email.

The URL gets shared right in the browser of the other user.
